%The proposed work advances the DOE Office of Science’s mission by integrating algorithmic innovation and quantum error management in a co-design framework. Our approach couples adaptive quantum error correction and mitigation with algorithm development tailored to representative DOE workloads—such as materials and chemical simulations (BES) and quantum modeling of nuclear and high-energy physics systems (NP/HEP). Through the QUARC framework, algorithm parameters, noise-aware decision strategies, and hardware execution constraints are co-optimized to achieve reliable, resource-efficient computation of domain-specific observables. This direct coupling of algorithm design and error control will improve both the fidelity and scalability of quantum computations for DOE mission-relevant science, fulfilling the FOA’s goal of end-to-end quantum software stack co-design.
