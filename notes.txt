*** Unique challenges faced by Quantum Path Selection vs Regular Path selection

- Since you cannot copy "clone" qubits, then this eliminates many variations of routing techniques
- Paths carry entanglement and not packets
- Problablistc nature, no deterministic link costs
-

Is this correct: In entaglement swapping, lets assume A wants to talk to B, with a router in the middle. A would create and enangelment with the router (C) and another qubit in the router (D) would make an enanglement with B. C and D would then become entangled therefore essentially creating a link between A an B


So are the 4 bell states basically: 1) Both qubits are 0, 2) Both Qubits are 1, 3) 1 qubit is  .....? Finish this
